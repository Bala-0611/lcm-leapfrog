# 🐸 LCM Leapfrog  

An interactive math game that teaches the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** concept in a fun, visual way.  
Two frogs race across lily pads — their jumps represent multiples, and the first pad they share is the **LCM**!

---

## ✨ How It Works

The game simplifies the abstract concept of LCM into a simple, visual race:

1. **Assign Jumps:** Two frogs, one green and one blue, are each given a "jump number".  
2. **Start Leaping:** The frogs start at lily pad 0 and begin jumping.  
   - The green frog leaps by its assigned number.  
   - The blue frog leaps by its number.  
3. **Track the Path:** As they jump, the game tracks all the lily pads (multiples) each frog lands on.  
4. **Find the Match:** The first lily pad that both frogs land on is their **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**.  
   - The game celebrates the discovery and highlights the answer!

## 🎮 Controls & How to Play

Getting started is easy! Follow these simple steps:

### 🐸 Set the Jump Numbers
- Use the **"Frog 1 Jumps By"** input to set the jump distance for the green frog.  
- Use the **"Frog 2 Jumps By"** input to set the jump distance for the blue frog.  
> 💡 Numbers must be different and between **2 and 20** for the best experience.

### 🏁 Start the Animation
- Click the **"Start Jumping!"** button.  
- The frogs will begin to leap across the lily pads according to their numbers.  
- The button shows **"Jumping..."** and becomes disabled during the animation.

### 🔁 Reset the Game
- Click the **"Reset"** button to stop the animation and return the frogs to the starting position.  
- Great for trying new numbers instantly!

### 💬 Get an Explanation
- Once the frogs find the LCM, a success panel appears.  
- Click **"Explain it differently!"** to get a new analogy.  
- 🧠 Powered by **Google Gemini API**, the app gives creative, simple explanations of the LCM for your chosen numbers.
