‚ú® How It Works
The game simplifies the abstract concept of LCM into a simple, visual race:
Assign Jumps: Two frogs, one green and one blue, are each given a "jump number".
Start Leaping: The frogs start at lily pad 0 and begin jumping. The green frog leaps by its assigned number, and the blue frog leaps by its number.
Track the Path: As they jump, the game tracks all the lily pads (multiples) each frog lands on.
Find the Match: The first lily pad that both frogs land on is their Least Common Multiple (LCM). The game celebrates the discovery and highlights the answer!
üéÆ Controls & How to Play
Getting started is easy! Follow these simple steps:
Set the Jump Numbers:
Use the "Frog 1 Jumps By" input to set the jump distance for the green frog.
Use the "Frog 2 Jumps By" input to set the jump distance for the blue frog.
Note: Numbers must be different and between 2 and 20 for the best experience.
Start the Animation:
Click the "Start Jumping!" button. The frogs will begin to leap across the lily pads according to their numbers. The button will show "Jumping..." and become disabled during the animation.
Reset the Game:
Click the "Reset" button at any time to stop the animation and return the frogs to the starting position. This is useful if you want to try new numbers.
Get an Explanation:
Once the frogs find the LCM, a success panel appears.
Click the "Explain it differently!" button inside this panel. Our friendly AI will provide a new, simple analogy to help you understand the concept of LCM for the numbers you chose.
